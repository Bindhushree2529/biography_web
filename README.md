Creating a biography website involves using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements. Here's a simple example of how you might structure and style a biography website.

How They Work Together:

* HTML: Structures the webpage content. For example, it defines sections for "About," "Portfolio," and "Contact."
* CSS: Styles the content defined by HTML. For instance, it sets the colors, fonts, and layout of the navigation bar and forms.
* JavaScript: Enhances interactivity and functionality. For example, it handles form submissions and provides user feedback without reloading the page.

In a biography website:

* HTML builds the framework with sections like "About," "Portfolio," and "Contact."
* CSS ensures the website looks attractive and maintains a consistent style.
* JavaScript manages interactive elements, such as form submissions and dynamic content updates.
